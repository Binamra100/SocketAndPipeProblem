# Pipe and Socket Problem

## Question
Given a set of n pipes of different sizes and n sockets of different sizes. There is a one to ­one mapping between pipes and sockets, meaning that a pipe can fit into only one socket. Match pipes and sockets efficiently.
Constraint: Comparison of a pipe to another pipe or a socket to another socket is not allowed. It means pipe can only be compared with socket and socket can only be compared with pipe to see which one is bigger/smaller.
Write a Program in your preferred Language to solve the above problem as efficiently as possible. Also, provide the complexity of the Solution and your reasoning behind the solution.
Expected time complexity: O(n) or less.
